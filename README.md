# Hi there

![miu-logo-white](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97438154/149523569-5bb35d9a-f6a2-4ad4-8c3e-5ffe1f370c44.png)

miu-lab is a little flying studio based in France.

We ❤️ build various stuff across some 3D packages.

Our main goal is to provide some solid tools for a better daily workflow in Houdini.

For now, we share this Github repository for free with few HDAs.

The current plan is to deliver a stable library of Utilities.

Some more advanced / higher level tools should be release further.
